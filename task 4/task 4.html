                <p>Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) was a German politician who became the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), commonly known as the Nazi Party. He rose to power as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and later FÃ¼hrer in 1934.</p>

                    Hitler's aggressive foreign policies triggered the outbreak of World War II in 1939, and he was responsible for the genocide known as the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were systematically murdered.
